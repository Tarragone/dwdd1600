        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mime_artist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mimes</a> Are historically Roman entertainers, now associated with France, that seek to please the masses with often humorous performances invloving a lack of sound. Mimes traditionally take a vow of silence at the age of 22, or whenever they decide to commit to the lifestyle. They can only talk while in a mime exclusive area, or when alone.</p>
        
        <h2>What do they do?</h2>
        <p> The average mime roams the streets of their European hometown, performing their art on the streets. They make a living off of donations given to them by generous passerbiers, who throw any loose change in their pockets on the cobbles in front of the mimes. The best of the mimes instead perform on stages, often in front of wealthy patrons or higher ranking officials. To keep with tradition, the money the make is still thrown onto stage. </p>
