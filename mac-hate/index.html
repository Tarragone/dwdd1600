        <h1>What is a mac</h1>
        
     
        
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mac</a> is a home computer, also known as a Macintosh. While originally a revolutionary product that made increadible advances in the world of personal computers, it is now the desperate attempt of an overpiced phone company to try and stay relevant in the computer industry by releasing deceptive computers. By learning to use on, you accustom yourself to their strange UI that renders you incompitent to any of the more standard computing interfaces. This forces the user to continue consuming Apple products, desptite their many issues.</p>
        
        <h2>What are the issues?</h2>
        <h3>Issues with the OS</h3>
        <p>These issues, while they might be proclaimed as "non issues" or "acceptable trade offs" or "made up entirely" by Apple fanboys, are undeniable and terrible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Expensive. Not worth the price for the inadequete computer</li>
            <li>Spyware. They're watching you. Admitidly most OS watch you, with a few exclusions, but the Mac is no expception</li>
            <li>Lack of computer access. It's a lot harder to alter the inner workings of your software.</li>
            <li>Terrible UI. While the big screens look real nice, the interface in within many applications is foul.</li>
            <li>Finder. Why. Finder is the alternative to the  microsoft file explorer, and it's cumbersome, difficult, and ineffective.</li>
            <li>The UI. Again. Dear god. Just try and navigate around your computer./li>
            <li>The keyboard shortcuts. Most of them are the same as other computers, but there are random exceptions. Microsoft, chrome, and other OS agree on what alt tab should do, but not Mac./li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Issues with hardware</h3>
        <p>Oh boy. The hardware. The monitors most macs use are good. I'll give them that. But past that? Oh dear lord. We'll start with the mouse. The mouse. Oh. Just one look at the common apple mouse is positivley disgusting. Foul. An affront to ergonomics and humanity. Anyone with a large hand is going to experience hell using one. Their tiny frame makes the hand sit uncomfortably around the entire mouse. If you have a smal ahnd, your wrist can't rest comfortably while also letting you reach the front of the mouse. Speaking of the front of the mouse, it's terribl. Basically a glorified touchpad from a thinkpad or chromebook. Hot dang. No scroll wheel either. No easy way to right click. No way to click at all. Just smooth, like the brains of the people who made the thing</p>
        <p>The other issue with the hardware is the keyboard. Oh man. Buckle up. As bad as the mouse wa, at least it was basically just a touchpad you could hold. The keyboard pretends to be a keyboard, but isn't. The devil appears as an angel to fool man. When you first see a standard mac keyboard, it's small size should offput you. It's incredibly slim, and for no good reason. You could snap it easier then a kit-kat bar. Theres nowhere to put your hands. If you looked away, it might slip away from existince entirely. When you look at the keys, you notice another strange thing. The command key. Next to the control key. It isn't a replacement for the control key, but an addition. One that replaces the ctrl key in 90% of scenarios, but not always. And there has been no use ever found for having one anywhere near a keyboard. It serves as a mockery to humans, exersising its own control over you. Mocking you as it sits ackwardly away from where you insticts tell you to press. And when you do press? when you press any button the the keyboard its like pushing your finger against bubble wrap, only to realize it's already been popped. It's like touching air, but nasty, plasticy, and dissapointing. When you fail to feel anything from the flaccid keys, it makes you doubt wether you've really pressed anything at all. A complete lack of substance is a running theme for Macs that is especially amplified by the keyboad. I wouldn't know I was typing right now if it wasn't for the words cowardly appearing on screen, embarresed to have been typed by a mac. I could talk about the terrible keys for a long time, but I'm trying to keep this snappy. The final issue I'll touch on for now is the small size. This thing is smaller then a chromebook keyboard. They wanted to save precious plastic so badly they'dgive you a keyboard fit for a rat. Maybe the rats at the head of the company wanted something to type with, and they didn't have the strength to press any key with any amount of resistance more then 1 micrometer apart.</p>
